1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location
   hdfs dfs -put /home/cloudera/data/sales_order_data.csv /tmp/hive_class/

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

hive> create table sales_order_csv
     (
     ORDERNUMBER STRING,
     QUANTITYORDERED int,
     PRICEEACH float,
     ORDERLINENUMBER int,
     SALES int,
     STATUS string,
     QTR_ID int,
     MONTH_ID int,
     YEAR_ID int,
     PRODUCTLINE string,
     MSRP int,
     PRODUCTCODE string,
     PHONE string,
     CITY string,
     STATE string,
     POSTALCODE int,
     COUNTRY string,
     TERRITORY string,
     CONTACTLASTNAME string,
     CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
     DEALSIZE string
     )
     row format delimited
     fields terminated by ',';

Time taken: 5.367 seconds
hive> set hive.cli.print.header=true;

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 

load data inpath '/tmp/hive_class/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_order_csv;
alter table sales_order_csv set tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1");

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"
hive> create table sales_order_orc
     (
     ORDERNUMBER STRING,
     QUANTITYORDERED int,
     PRICEEACH float,
     ORDERLINENUMBER int,
     SALES int,
     STATUS string,
     QTR_ID int,
     MONTH_ID int,
     YEAR_ID int,
     PRODUCTLINE string,
     MSRP int,
     PRODUCTCODE string,
     PHONE string,
     CITY string,
     STATE string,
     POSTALCODE int,
     COUNTRY string,
     TERRITORY string,
     CONTACTLASTNAME string,
     CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
     DEALSIZE string
     )
stored as orc;

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"
hive> insert into table sales_order_orc select * from sales_order_csv;


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
hive> select year_id,sum(sales) as Total_Sales from sales_order_orc group by year_id;

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
hive> select sum(quantityordered) as Total_Quantity_Ordered,productline from sales_order_orc group by productline limit 1;

c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
hive> select year_id,qtr_id,sum(sales) as Total_Quarterly_Sales  from sales_order_orc group by year_id, qtr_id;

d. In which quarter sales was minimum
hive> select collect_set(year_id)[0],collect_set(qtr_id)[0],MIN(Total_Minimum_qtr_sales)as Qtr_Min_Sales from(select s.year_id, s.qtr_id,sum(s.sales)as Total_Minimum_qtr_sales from sales_order_orc s group by s.year_id, s.qtr_id) TQS;

e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
