1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location
   hdfs dfs -put /home/cloudera/data/sales_order_data.csv /tmp/hive_class/

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

hive> create table sales_order_csv
     (
     ORDERNUMBER STRING,
     QUANTITYORDERED int,
     PRICEEACH float,
     ORDERLINENUMBER int,
     SALES int,
     STATUS string,
     QTR_ID int,
     MONTH_ID int,
     YEAR_ID int,
     PRODUCTLINE string,
     MSRP int,
     PRODUCTCODE string,
     PHONE string,
     CITY string,
     STATE string,
     POSTALCODE int,
     COUNTRY string,
     TERRITORY string,
     CONTACTLASTNAME string,
     CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
     DEALSIZE string
     )
     row format delimited
     fields terminated by ',';

hive> set hive.cli.print.header=true;

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 

load data inpath '/tmp/hive_class/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_order_csv;
alter table sales_order_csv set tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1");

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
d. In which quarter sales was minimum
e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
